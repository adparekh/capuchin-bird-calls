## Introduction

In this deep learning project, an initiative has been undertaken to develop a machine learning model and accompanying code for the purpose of quantifying the number of Capuchin bird calls within given audio clips.

The provided dataset encompasses a training set consisting of short audio clips (3-5 seconds in duration), containing instances of Capuchin bird calls (positive examples), as well as other short audio clips of the same duration that lack Capuchin bird calls (negative examples). Additionally, a testing set is provided, comprising longer forest audio files (3-6 minutes in duration), where the objective is to determine the count of Capuchin bird calls.

The project methodology unfolds with the conversion of all training set audio files into spectrogram images, serving as the foundation for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image classification model. This model is engineered to ascertain the presence or absence of Capuchin bird calls within an audio file. Subsequently, attention is directed towards the testing setâ€”specifically, the longer audio files. These are segmented into smaller audio slices, each spanning 3-5 seconds, and subjected to predictions regarding the presence of Capuchin bird calls utilizing the pre-trained CNN classification model. To obtain the total count of Capuchin bird calls, the prediction values for individual audio slices within a given file are aggregated through summation, culminating in the derivation of the final count.

This project endeavors to contribute to the field of automated bioacoustic analysis by offering an effective solution for the identification and enumeration of Capuchin bird calls in larger audio recordings.

## Data Description

The provided dataset is organized into three distinct folders, each contributing unique audio clips tailored for specific aspects of the project:

  1. `Forest Recordings`:
        This folder is designated for the prediction of bird call counts and serves as the test dataset.
        Contains long audio clips ranging from 3 to 6 minutes in duration.
        The objective is to produce the final prediction for the presence of Capuchin bird calls within these extended audio recordings.
        This section of the dataset serves as the benchmark against which the developed model's efficacy will be evaluated.

  2. `Parsed_Capuchinbird_Clips`:
        Constituting a crucial segment of the training set, this folder comprises short audio clips lasting 3 to 5 seconds.
        These clips are characterized by the inclusion of Capuchin bird calls, thereby functioning as positive examples for the machine learning model.
        The distinctive feature of Capuchin bird calls within this subset facilitates the training process, enabling the model to learn and identify the relevant acoustic patterns associated with Capuchin presence.

  3. `Parsed_Not_Capuchinbird_Clips`:
        Also integral to the training set, this folder encompasses short audio clips spanning 3 to 5 seconds each.
        In contrast to the previous category, these clips serve as negative examples, devoid of Capuchin bird calls.
        The absence of Capuchin bird calls in this subset aids the model in discerning features that distinguish between instances with and without Capuchin bird calls, contributing to a robust classification framework.

This well-structured dataset is designed to facilitate the training and evaluation of a machine learning model, fostering the development of an effective system for the automated identification and enumeration of Capuchin bird calls within audio recordings.

## Conclusion

The achieved recall and precision values of 1.0 for both the training and validation sets underscore the remarkable effectiveness of the developed classification model in accurately identifying Capuchin bird calls within short audio clips. These exceptional performance metrics on the training and validation data suggest that the model has successfully learned discriminative features, generalizing well to previously unseen examples during validation.

Analyzing the exported results in the CSV file will shed light on the model's ability to generalize to larger, more complex datasets. Potential challenges may include handling background noise, variations in bird call patterns, and other acoustic complexities inherent in forest recordings.

In conclusion, the project has successfully demonstrated the development of an effective machine learning model for Capuchin bird call identification, showcasing outstanding performance on training and validation data. The exported results from the testing set provide a valuable foundation for further refinement and potential enhancements to address challenges associated with real-world forest recordings. Ongoing efforts to iteratively improve the model's robustness and adaptability will contribute to its eventual deployment in bioacoustic analysis applications, affirming its potential significance in the broader field of automated wildlife sound recognition.
